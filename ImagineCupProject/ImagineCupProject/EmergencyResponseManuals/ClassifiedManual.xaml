                    1. Minor earthquake:<LineBreak/>
                    - EC and DGS will inspect the facility to determine the condition of:<LineBreak/>
                        1) Piping systems (water, gas, sewer)<LineBreak/>
                        2) Electrical system<LineBreak/>
                        3) Telephone system<LineBreak/>
                        4) Structure – walls, doors, windows, ceiling, etc.<LineBreak/>
                    - EC and or DGS will report the earthquake and any resulting damage to the Facility Manager.<LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    2. Moderate, major or catastrophic earthquake:<LineBreak/>
                    - Shelter in place if possible until the shaking stops (in doorways and away from windows).<LineBreak/>
                    - Facility evacuation plan will be implemented once the shaking has stopped.
                    All employees will follow the emergency evacuation plan and report to their designated areas. A roll-call will be conducted to determine if anyone remains in the building.<LineBreak/>
                    - The building will be visually inspected by EC and DGS for damage and hazards.<LineBreak/>
                    - If an employee is missing from the roll-call, and the building appears safe, the EC will check inside.<LineBreak/>
                    - If no hazards or structurally unsafe damage is found, allow the facility to be reoccupied.<LineBreak/>
                    - If structural damage and hazards are found:<LineBreak/>
                        1) Determine if they are hazardous to the building occupants.<LineBreak/>
                        2) If severe or widespread damage is discovered, do not allow the building to be used.<LineBreak/>
                        3) Call DCP, who will establish security around the building to prevent unauthorized entry, and notify Richmond Fire Department.<LineBreak/>                        4) If approved by the fire department, escort personnel to their work areas to retrieve personal belongings<LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    NOTE: Extreme caution must be used when entering and inspecting the building. If significant wall, floor or roof damage is observed, do not enter the building.<LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    3. Prepare for earthquakes.<LineBreak/>
                    - Securely fasten shelves to walls.<LineBreak/>
                    - Keep large or heavy objects on lower shelves.<LineBreak/>
                    - Store breakable items in lower cabinets with doors and latches.<LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    4. Plan to act quickly.<LineBreak/>
                    - During or immediately after an earthquake, the best protection is to get under heavy furniture, such as a desk, table or bench, and staying away from large windows, mirrors or other glass.<LineBreak/>
                    - The greatest danger is directly outside buildings, at exits, and along exterior walls, due to falling debris. Most deaths and injuries are due to falling walls, flying glass and debris.<LineBreak/>
                    - If you are already outside, stay clear of buildings, power lines, overpasses and elevated expressways.<LineBreak/>
                    - Expect aftershocks – smaller quakes (and sometimes larger ones) can often follow hours or days after the initial shake, causing further damage to weakened buildings and structures.<LineBreak/>
                    - If you smell gas or hear a hissing or blowing noise, open a window and leave the building immediately; turn off the gas at the outside main valve, if possible, and call the gas company.<LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    5. Post- earthquake concerns:<LineBreak/>
                    Following a major or catastrophic earthquake, damage to roads, bridges, utilities and other structures in the vicinity of the state facility may prevent or hinder the employee’s ability to travel home.<LineBreak/>
                    Consideration must be given to providing information to employees regarding safe or open routes home, and providing temporary shelter if all routes are closed.<LineBreak/>
                    Additional concerns must be given to the possibility that personal belongings such as keys, briefcases, and medications cannot be retrieved from the damaged building. If damage is widespread and travel is not feasible:<LineBreak/>
                    - Set up a temporary shelter.<LineBreak/>
                    - Locate a source of water and stockpile if possible.<LineBreak/>
                    - Determine location of operating community shelters, and move employees there if possible.

                    - EC should move all employees to the safe area within the building.<LineBreak/>
                    - Employees should remain in the safe area until the warning has been cancelled.<LineBreak/>

                    - If underground shelter is not available, go into a windowless interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible.<LineBreak/>
                    - Stay away from windows, doors and outside walls. Go to the center of the room. Stay away from corners - they attract debris.<LineBreak/>
                    - If shelter is not available, lie flat in a ditch or other low-lying area.<LineBreak/>
                    - Plan to stay in the shelter location until the storm has passed.<LineBreak/>

                    1. Immediate Action:<LineBreak/>
                    - Notify the Richmond Fire Department (9-911).<LineBreak/>
                    - Give the dispatcher the address, location of the fire, and if there are any injuries.<LineBreak/>
                    - Notify DCP (786-4357).<LineBreak/>
                    - If the internal fire alarm system has not activated, or fails to operate, immediately activate the system.<LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    2. Emergency Escape Actions:<LineBreak/>
                    - Stay calm.<LineBreak/>
                    - Immediately stop what you are doing.<LineBreak/>
                    - Follow the building’s Building Emergency Evacuation Plan (BEEP) and report to your designated staging area. Stay low to the ground to avoid rising smoke.<LineBreak/>
                    - In multi-level buildings, sometimes the safest action may be for employees to stay inside and protect themselves from the smoke and fire.
                    “Safe areas” should be identified before-hand where employees or employees with disabilities will gather prior to the arrival of the fire department.<LineBreak/>
                    When this happens, employees should:<LineBreak/>
                        1) Take steps to protect themselves, and stay calm.<LineBreak/>
                        2) Exterior windows and all doors should be properly marked to alert emergency personnel that employees are gathered inside.<LineBreak/>
                        3) Make sure there is a phone in the safe areas.

                    <LineBreak/>
                    4. CALL 9-911. Critical incident emergency situations should be reported to law enforcement immediately or as soon as possible when it becomes safe to do so. Be prepared to give the following information:<LineBreak/>
