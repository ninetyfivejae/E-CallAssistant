                    1. Immediate Action - Secure the Immediate Area.
                    - Lock or barricade the door, if able. Block the door using whatever is available - desks, tables, file cabinets, other furniture, books, etc.
                    - After securing the door, stay behind solid objects away from the door as much as possible.
                    - If the assailant enters your room and leaves, lock or barricade the door behind them.
                    - If safe to do so, allow others to seek refuge with you.
                    
                    2. Protective Actions: Take appropriate steps to reduce your vulnerability.
                    - Close blinds.
                    - Close windows.
                    - Turn off radios and computer monitors.
                    - Silence cell phones.
                    - Place signs in exterior windows to identify your location and the location of injured persons.
                    - Keep people calm and quiet.
                    - After securing the room, people should be positioned out of sight and behind items that might offer additional protection - walls, desks, file cabinets, bookshelves, etc.
                    
                    3. Unsecured Areas:
                    - If you find yourself in an open area, immediately seek protection.
                    - Put something between you and the assailant.
                    - Consider trying to escape, if you know where the assailant is and there appears to be an escape route immediately available to you.
                    - If in doubt, find the safest area available and secure it the best way that you can.
                    
                    4. CALL 786-4357 (HELP) then 9-911. Critical incident emergency situations should be reported to law enforcement immediately or as soon as possible when it becomes safe to do so. Be prepared to give the following information:
                    - What is happening.
                    - Where you are located, including building name, floor and room number.
                    - Number of people at your specific location.
                    - Injuries, if any, number of those injured and types of injuries.
                    - Other information as requested.
                    - Try to provide information in a calm, clear manner so that the dispatcher can quickly relay your information to responding emergency personnel.
                    
                    5. What to Report: Try to note as much as possible about the assailant, including:
                    - Specific location and direction of the assailant.
                    - Number of assailants.
                    - Gender, race, and approximate age of the assailant.
                    - Clothing color and style.
                    - Physical features – e.g., height, weight, facial hair, glasses.
