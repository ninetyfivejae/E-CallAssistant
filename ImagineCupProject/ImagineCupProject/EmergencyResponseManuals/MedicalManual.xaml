                    The patient's level of consciousness is assessed by how well they respond to questions. <LineBreak/>
                    The ALOC Nature Code is used for patients that are not responding in a manner that is normal for them. <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    The ALOC Nature Code is not used when patients are completely unresponsive. <LineBreak/>
                    A patient that is completely unresponsive has a more critical need for airway management and breathing assessment. <LineBreak/>
                    The UNC Nature Code will give specific questions to assess these patients for the need to perform rescue breathing or CPR. <LineBreak/>
                    An immediate ALS response will be dispatched as soon as the chief complaint of ALOC is stated and the following questions would be asked after the initial call has been dispatched. <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Key Questions <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    1. Does the patient have a history of any medical problems? <LineBreak/>

                    Chest pain is the most common specific medical complaint for which EMS services are routinely called. <LineBreak/>
                    Chest pain as the chief complaint may indicate a heart attack, pulmonary embolism, and other serious conditions; <LineBreak/>
                    or, may indicate a benign condition requiring little or no medical intervention. <LineBreak/>
                    Since it is very difficult to determine the severity or nature of the pain over the phone, all chest pain calls are considered ALS. <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    An immediate ALS response will be dispatched as soon as the chief complaint of CP is stated and the following questions would be asked after the initial call has been dispatched. <LineBreak/>

                    Reporting of fall victims is common. The FED will dispatch a BLS response unless <LineBreak/>
                    there are reports of ALS signs/symptoms or that the fall was from greater than ten feet. <LineBreak/>
                    Falls of greater than ten feet are considered long falls and require an ALS response. <LineBreak/>
                    With any long fall, a possible spinal injury exists. The length of the fall is the easiest <LineBreak/>
                    determinant of severity. The FED must consider the possibility that external trauma as <LineBreak/>
                    well as internal injuries may exist. <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Pre-arrival instructions should be limited to controlling any gross bleeding and <LineBreak/>
                    cautioning the caller not to move the victim so that further injury is not caused. <LineBreak/>
                    FALL is a BLS response. FALLA is an ALS response. <LineBreak/>

                    Each gunshot wound incident involves violence with police priorities. It is important to <LineBreak/>

                    <LineBreak/>
                    Many callers reporting these incidents often have an emotional response to the <LineBreak/>

                    Approximately 25% of all EMS calls originate as unknown medical problems. A sick <LineBreak/>
                    person is a patient who has an indefinable chief complaint, unclear symptoms, or when <LineBreak/>
                    the caller provides specific information on a previous diagnosis. A second party caller is <LineBreak/>
                    often the reporting person. <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Once it has been established that there are no life threatening problems, the FED will <LineBreak/>
                    try to ascertain a chief complaint. If the chief complaint continues to be vague, this <LineBreak/>
                    protocol should be utilized. When a major complaint is not readily distinguishable it is <LineBreak/>
                    difficult to make triage decisions. Use common sense and ask questions if time permits. <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>
                    Multiple patients complaining of headaches, nausea or being disorientated may be <LineBreak/>
